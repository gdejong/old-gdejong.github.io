It's the first day of December, which means it's time for another installment of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020)!

The Advent of Code is a daily programming challenge for every day of December until Christmas.
You choose how you want to solve the challenges: Python, Golang, PHP or Microsoft Excel? It's entirely up to you!

If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend you give it a go.
Discussing them with colleagues is a lot of fun since most of the time you don't work on exactly the same problem, but now you can.
This creates an opportunity to learn from each other.

The Advent of Code is *free* for everybody to use.
If you like it and if you can spare some change, please consider supporting the project by [making a small donation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/support).
You even get a cool AoC++ badge next to your name!

My solutions for 2020 can be found [at github](https://github.com/gdejong/advent-of-code-2020).

Happy coding!
