Have you ever wanted to make your shell script interactive?
Or have you ever wanted to display a full screen message from your shell script?
[**Whiptail**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/whiptail) can do this for you!

The [**docs**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/whiptail) describe Whiptail as follows:
> Whiptail is a program that will let you present a variety of questions or display messages using dialog boxes from a shell script. Currently, these types of dialog boxes are implemented:

It offers a couple of different dialog boxes:
- [message box](#message-box)
- [yes/no box](#yesno-box)
- [info box](#info-box)
- [input box](#input-box)
- [password box](#password-box)
- [text box](#text-box)
- [menu box](#menu-box)
- [checklist box](#checklist-box)
- [radiolist box](#radiolist-box)
- [gauge box](#gauge-box)

# Installation

On Debian based Linux distributions `whiptail` comes preinstalled.

If not you can grab it via:
```shell
apt-get install whiptail
```

Installation instructions for other Linux distros can be found at [https://command-not-found.com/whiptail](https://command-not-found.com/whiptail)

# Size of the dialog

All invocations of `whiptail` require you to specify a height (rows) and width (columns) of the dialog box to show.
For example `20 100`. It will take some trial and error before the box shows up nicely for your specific content.

# Types of dialog boxes

Whiptail offers a couple of different types of dialog boxes.

## Message box

A message box can be used to display some text. Script execution is paused until the user hits ENTER.

```shell
whiptail --msgbox "This is a message in a message box." 10 100
```

## Yes/no box

Here you can ask the user a question, by default the `Yes` button is selected

```shell
#!/bin/bash

if whiptail --yesno "Are you sure?" 10 100; then
  echo "Yes I am sure!"
else
  echo "No I am not sure!"
fi
```

![Whiptail yes/no box](/assets/img/whiptail/yesno-default-yes.png)

Use the option `--defaultno` to make `No` the default selected button

```shell
#!/bin/bash

if whiptail --yesno "Are you sure?" 10 100 --defaultno; then
  echo "Yes I am sure!"
else
  echo "No I am not sure!"
fi
```

## Info box
An info box is basically a message box without Whiptail waiting for the user to hit ENTER.

This dialog box **does not work** on `xterm` terminals (for example the default terminal in Ubuntu)!

A [workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13000391/how-to-display-infobox-in-whiptail) is possible though.

```shell
TERM=vt220 whiptail --infobox "Text from an info box." 10 100
```

![Whiptail info box](/assets/img/whiptail/infobox.png)


## Input box

Use an input box to ask the user to answer a question.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

NAME=$(whiptail --inputbox "Please enter your name" 10 100 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)
echo "name: $NAME"
```

The `3>&1 1>&2 2>&3` part switches the `stdout` and `stderr` file descriptors.
This is needed because we want to assign the user input to the variable `NAME`.
This variable will be assigned whatever the subshell command outputs to `stdout`,
only problem is that `whiptail` prints the input string to `stderr` by default.

## Password box

A password is just like an input box however it displays an `*` for every inputted character.

```shell
PASSWORD=$(whiptail --passwordbox "Please enter your password" 10 100 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)
```

![Whiptail password box](/assets/img/whiptail/password-box.png)

## Text box

A text box can be used to display the contents of a file. The `--scrolltext` option makes sure the user can scroll the dialog box.

```shell
whiptail --textbox file.txt 10 100 --scrolltext
```

![Whiptail text box](/assets/img/whiptail/textbox.png)

## Menu box

A menu can be used to present multiple options and having the user choose one option. Every menu item consists of a tag string and an item string.
The tag string is the name of the menu item - and will be printed to `stderr` (we use the stderr/stdout flip trick again to print the selected option to `stdout` instead) when the user hits ENTER. The item string is a description of the menu item.
Whiptail does not enforce tag strings to be unique.

After the height and width of the dialog box, another parameter is required: the height of the menu list.
You probably want this value to be lower than the height of the dialog box.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

CHOICE=$(whiptail --menu "Choose an option" 18 100 10 \
  "Tiny" "A description for the tiny option." \
  "Small" "A description for the small option." \
  "Medium" "A description for the medium option." \
  "Large" "A description for the large option." \
  "Huge" "A description for the huge option." 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)

if [ -z "$CHOICE" ]; then
  echo "No option was chosen (user hit Cancel)"
else
  echo "The user chose $CHOICE"
fi
```

## Checklist box

A checklist box is similar to a menu box, but it allows the user to select zero or more options.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

CHOICES=$(whiptail --separate-output --checklist "Choose options" 10 35 5 \
  "1" "The first option" ON \
  "2" "The second option" ON \
  "3" "The third option" OFF \
  "4" "The fourth option" OFF 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)

if [ -z "$CHOICE" ]; then
  echo "No option was selected (user hit Cancel or unselected all options)"
else
  for CHOICE in $CHOICES; do
    case "$CHOICE" in
    "1")
      echo "Option 1 was selected"
      ;;
    "2")
      echo "Option 2 was selected"
      ;;
    "3")
      echo "Option 3 was selected"
      ;;
    "4")
      echo "Option 4 was selected"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Unsupported item $CHOICE!" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
    esac
  done
fi
```

## Radiolist box

A radiolist is similar to a [menu box](#menu-box) but it allows you to set a default selected option.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

CHOICE=$(whiptail --separate-output --radiolist "Choose options" 10 35 5 \
  "1" "The first option" OFF \
  "2" "The second option" ON \
  "3" "The third option" OFF \
  "4" "The fourth option" OFF 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)

if [ -z "$CHOICE" ]; then
  echo "No option was chosen (user hit Cancel)"
else
  echo "The user chose $CHOICE"
fi
```

## Gauge box

The last type, the gauge box, can be used to display a progress bar.
Whiptail reads new percentages to update the progress bar from `stdin`.

The most difficult part of using this type of dialog box is knowing the progress of a command.
This really depends on the command that is being run, and it makes this the most difficult dialog type to use in my opinion.

# Options

Some options you may find useful:

## `--fb`

Display Full Buttons with a 3D-effect.

![Whiptail message box with full buttons](/assets/img/whiptail/messagebox-fb.png)

## `--title`

Add a title to the dialog box.

![Whiptail message box with a title](/assets/img/whiptail/messagebox-title.png)


## `--nocancel`

Do not show a Cancel button. Can for example be used together with a menu box.

# Tips

## Full screen?

In case you decide you want a full screen dialog box, you can use `stty` to give you the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the terminal.

```shell
whiptail --msgbox "Full screen!" $(stty size)
```
