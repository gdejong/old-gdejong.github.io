I have been using `watch` for some time now but only recently I found out it offers some options that make it even better!

# What is watch?

Watch is a program that repeatedly executes a command you tell it to and shows you the output.
This can be very useful when you want to observe the output of a program change over time.

# Useful options when using watch

Watch offers a couple of neat options.

## Highlight differences

`watch -d` (or `watch --differences`) points out the changes between the latest command output and the previous one.

### Cumulative mode

`watch --differences=cumulative` makes the highlights stick. In other words, all highlights remain visible and are never cleared.
 
Fun fact: you can actually [give any value to this option](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/-/blob/master/watch.c#L746) 
instead of `cumulative`, as long as you provide a value to the `--differences` option.

## Custom interval 

`watch -n <seconds>` (or `watch --interval <seconds>`) allows you to specify with what interval your command should be executed. 
By default, your command/program will be run with an interval of 2 seconds.

This interval may be less than 1, but the minimum interval is 0.1s. [Intervals less than 0.1 are capped at 0.1.](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/-/blob/master/watch.c#L782)

## Precise timekeeping

The last option I want to mention is `watch -p` (or `watch --precise`).

This makes `watch` try its best to run the command at precisely the interval you chose.

Using a combination of the above mentioned options we can see this behavior.

Let's try printing the precise timestamp every second:

```shell
watch -n 1 --differences=cumulative 'date --rfc-3339=ns'
```

Because we enabled cumulative mode we see what digits of the current timestamp change.

Now repeat the command with `-p`:

```shell
watch -p -n 1 --differences=cumulative 'date --rfc-3339=ns'
```

The tenths and hundreds units did not change, so the 1-second interval was better adhered to.

Does this really matter? That's up to you to decide. At least now you know about the possibility.
